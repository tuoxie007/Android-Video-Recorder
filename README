Android Video Recorder

A simple library using ffmpeg, libx264, and libfaac to record videos on Android.
Tested with Android NDK r6b.
Targeted to armv7-a with vfpv3-d16.

How To Build

1. Run ./pull_code.sh to pull ffmpeg, x264 and faac source code to current directory.
2. Run /path/to/android/ndk/build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh --install-dir=./toolchain
3. Edit build.sh and change NDK at the top to point to your NDK directory. Or you can set NDK as a env variable.
4. Open faac/frontend/main.c, remove all code in main function.
5. Run the following commands:
	./build.sh config faac
	./build.sh compile faac
	./build.sh config x264
	./build.sh compile x264
	./build.sh config ffmpeg
	./build.sh compile ffmpeg
6. You should now have ffmpeg/lib*.a. Copy the ffmpeg/ to your Project/jni/.

7. Look at the Android.mk file as reference of your Android.mk file.
